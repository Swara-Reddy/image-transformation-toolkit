Matrix-based image transformation using Python &amp; NumPy
# Matrix-Based Image Transformation Toolkit

# Overview
This project demonstrates how linear algebra and matrix operations are used to perform fundamental image transformations. Images are treated as numerical matrices, and transformations are applied using matrix multiplication implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy.

The project focuses on building a strong mathematical foundation for image processing and machine learning concepts.

#Concepts Covered
- Vectors and matrices
- Linear transformations
- Affine transformations
- Matrix multiplication
- Coordinate mapping
- Image representation as 2D matrices

---

#Transformations Implemented
- Scaling
- Rotation
- Shearing
- Reflection
- Combination of multiple transformations

Each transformation is implemented using its corresponding transformation matrix.
